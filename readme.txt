This program runs a restricted guessing game and a unrestricted guessing game.

For the restricted version, it displays sixteen choices for the user to choose from
and asks questions to determine which one the user chooses.

For the unrestricted version, it also displays the sixteen choices
and starts questions in the same manner. If user thinks of something not pre-specified,
the computer will ask the user to type in a question and answer and the thing and remember it.
